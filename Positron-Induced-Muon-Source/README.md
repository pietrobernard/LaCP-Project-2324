###  Description and Results
The work is part of a set of preliminary studies for [Low EMittance Muon Accelerator (LEMMA) Collaboration](https://inspirehep.net/experiments/1757491?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true).

Through a Monte Carlo simulation we study the kinematic features of a low emittance muon beams from e+ e- collisions at centre-of-mass energy just above the μ+ μ- production threshold corresponding to a positron beam of about 45 GeV. 

At the end we obtain the hits distribution in the detector plane and the momenta distributions in the laboratory frame for (anti-)muons.
Regarding of modeling we assumed a positron beam in which particles are uniform distribuited in a circle and with energies gaussian distributed. 
An angular smearing is also considered for each particle composing the incident beam. For the taghet we cosider a 6 cm thick Beryllium block and to obtain the hits distribution for μ+ and μ- we assume the presence of  a  2  meter long,  1.7  Tesla dipole magnet placed after the target. 

All the parameters set in the simulation are easily editable.
