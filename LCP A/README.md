# LaCP-Project-2324

Hi guys! Here's what:
* bibliography: contains papers, thesis and other docs regarding the subject of the project.
* LCP_projects_Y6: this is Zanetti's folder
* Positron-Induced-Muon-Source: this is our project that was already done by others in the past. It could be useful as a reference to check against.
